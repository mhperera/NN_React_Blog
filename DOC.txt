npx create-react-app app-name

cd app-name

code .

npm run start

file structure
    -- node_modules => all node dependencies
    -- public => all public file , public to the browser
    -- src => all our react code goes here
        -- index.js => get all reat components , mounting them to the DOM

======================================================================================
** COMPONENTS **

Self contained section of content

components contains of  
    - Template
    - Logic

html codes inside the component js file=>funtion=>return section is called JSX. Not really the HTML.

babel converts all JSX components into HTML and render that HTML in the DOM

JSX vs. HTML    
    - In HTML   <div class='test-class'></div>
    - In JSX    <div className='test-class'></div> 
    
    Because 'class' is a reserved keyword of Javascript

export default App // This means export the component and eneble to use where it is imported.

======================================================================================
** DYNAMIC VALUES IN TEMPLATE **

define variables inside the function before the return statement;

in the return JSX , add {} and put the variable name inside them.

can define strings and numbers , But cannot add boolean variables or objects like this.
